A few items have been bad or simply not arrived at all but I have been refunded each time. I like shopping from sellers who have a lot of photo reviews from previous customers. I find many sellers to be friendly and approachable when asking questions. The app itself is easy to use and has a few fun features; playing games to win coins and vouchers for example. One of the more unique aspects is finding an item by using image search.

It is not like WISH at all. Wish charges for delivery of every product that's why I don't like shopping in wish. Shopping with AliExpress has been like a habit. It's very convenient for me. If you are a shopaholic like me who likes buying little things such as mobile and fashion accessories, clothes and shoes. You can try buying from AliExpress. Some products quality may be little lower however you can check reviews from thousands of other buyers before purchasing ( which I reckon). Deliveries may take from 2-6 weeks in the UK however It can be delivered quicker or later than that depending on regions.

Read the description and the specifications!! The pictures are deceiving, it looks like you get hundreds, and then receive 5. Contact the store owner if you have questions they are extremely helpful and can customize your order at times. If you receive something in error, which is rare, contact the seller first, do not file a dispute unless they don\u2019t respond. Coupons can be applied, they are hard to figure out sometimes. Get used to using your account. You must confirm your orders when you receive them. I like reviewing what I have received and take pictures when I can so other shoppers can see what you actually get.

Don\u2019t worry though, usually it doesn\u2019t take this long; probably due to the pandemic. Another thing that is very difficult to do, is to review stamps (for paper crafts/scrapbook) and metal dies, because they have the same name and it doesn\u2019t not show if you are leaving the review for the stamp or the metal cutting Dies. The last thing that is very aggravating, is that when you\u2019re order is missing still and you want to put a dispute an order, you have to put a dispute for each individual item in your order; it will not let you dispute the entire order and this is extremely time consuming when you have a very large order. There are boxes to let you check them individually or as an entire order but there\u2019s no button that lets you do the entire order.

Think of it like many shops all under the umbrella of Aliexpress, like a mall. It\u2019s a portal to all of these shops and it does offer buyer protection but you have to do your due diligence. First, expect slow shipping because the goods have a long way to travel, slowly. Second, don\u2019t spend anything you are unwilling to lose (do your research, some stores are incredibly safe but there are questionable shops). When you get a package, take a video WHILE you open it. This will serve as proof if the item is damaged or missing parts of the order. And finally, communicate your with seller if there is a problem. Many times they will offer to make things right without intervention, but if things lead to a dispute do not close the dispute and/or accept a refund off of AliExpress.

Or with shipments that get clearly lost in some airport in China. What a normal e-commerce would have in such cases, is a clear communication channel to handle disputes and customer satisfaction. Instead AliExpress uses some robot interface to handle customer requests and when the customer is becoming exasperated he is finally put in a chat with some real customer service person, who usually tells him that the case is being investigated and will get reprioritized. The bottom line is that, even in cases you have not received the merchandise - and you will never receive it - it takes weeks if not months to get your money back.

If you know how to shop, you\u2019ll always get great deals and good quality items!!\nI\u2019ve been on AliExpress for a few years and have made some mistakes. Here is how I\u2019ve managed to get a loot better:\n\n1. When you shop on there make sure you always arrange your searches by most popular/most reviewed so you can see reviews and ratings, as well as items people have mostly purchased (seriously you can see over 1000 buys and reviews for one item:)\n\n2. Do not buy anything unless there are picture reviews. If you do, be cautious. There are products that have over 300 photo reviews so you can go through each photo to make sure it\u2019s what you want. Most products on AliExpress use photos from outside sources that don\u2019t nessasarily reflect the actual product. So photo reviews are really important.\n\n3. When you find a product, scroll down to see if you can find the same one (on the related items) for cheaper. I\u2019ve saved a lot of money looking around. The more you look, the better your chances!\n\n4. Look at the sellers ratings. The higher their ratings, the more legitimate their products are\n\nIt\u2019s about being observant and looking around! Be cautious and pay attention. \nOnce you get the hang of it, Ali is one of the best apps you can have. I\u2019ve saved so much money on items I\u2019d have otherwise bought for twice the price. \nI love AliExpress!!\nHappy shopping!",isEdited:"False",userName:"Mumu_Lukw",rating:5},{id:42,title:"SAVE MONEY, GREAT SERVICE, NO RISK SHOPPING",date:"2019-06-28 02:31:10",review:"This app lets you take advantage of overseas pricing instead of the stores. Ok I don\u2019t like that manufacturing has been given away to other countries with cheap labor, but since they need jobs too I might as well buy directly from them and save the middle man mark-ups. \n\nThere is a no risk guarantee from Ali Express and they will enforce customer satisfaction. The products I review are only ones I have received.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen pictures of the items sent to others but  some customers are happy with less quality. So look at the pictures carefully and judge for yourself. Only buy if you see a picture of the ACTUAL item. I don\u2019t like that sellers can post pictures from any magazine or designer site, then copy it without posting their own pictures. Often the item looks nothing like the product being sold! I\u2019ve heard of a dog bath arriving that was 3\u201d - for a doll house!\n\nDon\u2019t trust every seller and every product. Learn who is making good products. Some hit and misses, but overall a great opportunity to save money. I have bought things I cannot afford in the US market. Ali Express makes this possible. \n\nFinally, Ali would do well to insist on full refunds when the quality is poor. That way you\u2019ll eliminate the scammers. Some sellers just send junk and get away with it. We cannot get a full refund. Return shipping is almost $100 for dresses - so obviously no one will return anything!

If a store doesn\u2019t have reviews on ANY of their products or they have repeat reviews, do not buy from them because you can get scammed. A lot of people complain of being scammed but tbh they just didn\u2019t use their common sense or do enough investigating. Also, people will leave bad reviews on hair, but don\u2019t even know how to comb it, embarrassing but yea STOP! The ONLY problem is the shipping. It takes FOREVER to come y\u2019all.

The time to shipping is from the time the order is placed until the vendor actually ships the item.  Perhaps vendors need to provide quantity in stock parameters.\n\nThe second issue I have is regarding truth in product description.  AliExpress needs to set rules for vendors products descriptions.  For example, products advertised as genuine leather should not include synthetic materials including PU leather.

The advice I can give always read others reviews and see what there experiences have been when they purchase and that way you\u2019ll feel a bit secure when ordering. If I don\u2019t see reviews on a item I don\u2019t order . Most things I\u2019ve order takes about 4-6 weeks to get which I think if you want more expedited you would have to communicate with the venders personally.
