    "review": "I LOVE AliExpress! When I come across anything I like on other shopping sites, I always check AliExpress and usually find the same item or something so similar that any difference(s) is so minor that it’s unimportant. And the items on AE’s app are usually a far better price. I’m a visual artist and crafter and, if I can wait out the delivery time (which is sometimes only 2-4 weeks, but usually 1-1/2 to 2 months), I’ve found countless fabulous deals on supplies, tools, even DIY project kits. I’ve also been able to create an awesome wardrobe of stylish, cutting-edge clothing, shoes, accessories and costume jewelry, for remarkably affordable prices. I really needed to fashionably express myself after turning 40 and going through a divorce a few years back, and have been able to do so without wasting my money on fast fashion, fads or boring “middle-aged lady” clothes. They have “middle-aged lady” clothes if that’s what you want, but the possibilities are endless. And the app is so user-friendly. I’m getting married again (to someone wonderful this time) and have even found and purchased my exquisite, perfectly made wedding gown and reception dress, plus shoes and accessories as well as many of our decorative elements, on the AliExpress app. I can’t recommend this app highly enough. I love love love it!",

    "review": "I can wait to get to my mailbox to see what has come today. I am a diamond member, I suggest start out slow so you learn how this app works. Learn how to go to the store itself and look at its rating. I only order from stores that rate a 4.8 or above. Look at the pictures that the customers post in the ratings and read what they say. Shipping is long if it’s free and sometimes is not tracked. Pay for better shipping methods if you can. Read the description and the specifications!! The pictures are deceiving, it looks like you get hundreds, and then receive 5. Contact the store owner if you have questions they are extremely helpful and can customize your order at times. If you receive something in error, which is rare, contact the seller first, do not file a dispute unless they don’t respond. Coupons can be applied, they are hard to figure out sometimes. Get used to using your account. You must confirm your orders when you receive them. I like reviewing what I have received and take pictures when I can so other shoppers can see what you actually get. I have ordered from hundreds of stores and have had only 2 errors!! My orders are usually for crafting. Be careful with sizes, they usually run small. Electronics are probably a risky purchase. Best advice: Read the specifications! Read the descriptions!!\nHave fun receiving Christmas every day!",

    "review": "It’s a great app and a great place to shop but not all sellers are cooperative. I just had a seller June electronicity/Junnuo tech. Store took their time getting back to me and was slowly helping me. It was like they were stretching the return limit so you’d end up with a faulty product. Then after I told them what was wrong and sent a video of the obnoxious noise it was making. They told me that “ it’s a normal sound my friend” which wasn’t supposed to sound like that at all, so they will give faulty advice as well. Very sneaky and unscrupulous. Many other seller have done the same or had another tactic. But I had no idea that 15days after you get product there’s no return etc. the seller was being politely unhelpful and ended up with a brand new product that runs like it is 15yrs old. They wouldn’t help and was being childish. This was just my last mishap with a seller I’ve lost so much money on this site it’s sad. I would highly recommend only buying once and a while when they have better prices or sales. But I would suggest you just go to eBay cause same sellers but they have to follow American rules and policies. So be very careful there are good sellers that don’t try to trick you but there are very unscrupulous sellers on this site as I imagine they did this to just me I’m sure they tricked others as well. I usually compare prices then if I have to order from here I will but typically go elsewhere.",

    "review": "The old saying is true that if it seems too good to be true then usually it is. I have doubt that this app is no exception. There are a few things that I have received and found them to be a good bargain. But oftentimes in order to get decent items, you’re paying close to what you would in a store near you. I’ve found that often times companies will take pictures very close up to an object to make it appear larger than it is so when you receive it you are really aggravated that it is so small. No wonder it was so cheap. And finally, I’ve found that there are shops you must watch out for because they have marketed something as theirs only to find out they have stolen it from another artist in another part of the world and there’s not a whole lot that can be done about it. But I can’t help but laugh at the USA when they outsource their products to make a bigger profit because all they have done is given the opponent their secrets and they just produce it under their name and make them a competitor. I used to like this app but I’m not near as fond of it as I once was. Also, I’ve had to file a lot more disputes because of either not getting something or getting a defective product. Finally, the shipping has become much more expensive in the past six months. You have to be careful of that now. So it is what it is and you get what you pay for in the long run.",

    "review": "I recently started using AliExpress for name brand bicycle parts at a great price. So far I’ve received everything I’ve purchased from this website. Most everything comes from China so there’s an extra wait time to receive stuff. If you use the mobile app you sometimes can save a little extra then using the website. You’ll be amazed how much you can save from buying from China. Lots of things are brand name items and the items that aren’t brand the quality is real good. Most everything you buy in the US comes from Asia anyway. You just cut out the middleman. AliExpress is easy to use. Most all the sellers respond to your questions so you can ask anything before you buy. There English is a little broken so you’ll have to read between the lines. Just be sure to check the sellers feedback before you buy. You’ll want to be sure to buy from a reputable seller with a good history. I’ve purchased a carbon wheel set for $500 where the name brand wheels would cost $2,500. The ride quality is great no complaints. If you do have an issue support will freeze the payment to the seller until the issue is resolved and you have control to release the funds to the seller or get a refund.",

    "review": "For the most part the app works well as other apps of the same type. However, there are times I am looking for something and it totally misunderstands what I am telling it in the search. The other problem I see, is that there’s no way to track your shipment once it leaves China. I waited almost 5 months before I got my last order. Don’t worry though, usually it doesn’t take this long; probably due to the pandemic. Another thing that is very difficult to do, is to review stamps (for paper crafts/scrapbook) and metal dies, because they have the same name and it doesn’t not show if you are leaving the review for the stamp or the metal cutting Dies. The last thing that is very aggravating, is that when you’re order is missing still and you want to put a dispute an order, you have to put a dispute for each individual item in your order; it will not let you dispute the entire order and this is extremely time consuming when you have a very large order. There are boxes to let you check them individually or as an entire order but there’s no button that lets you do the entire order. And it’s the same when you receive your item; even if you get the whole shipment in one envelope. If these things get fixed I’ll probably will give it 5 stars.",

    "review": "This is unreliable, I lost so much money from stores not refunding like they promised.. l lost at least $200 total. \nA SELLER canceled my order of $112.. and when I tried to open a dispute the highest refund I could request was $16!!!!. so I canceled dispute and decided to wait the 48 days to try to get a full refund.. The seller has ignored every attempt I’ve made to reach out the them.. I’m still not sure what’s going to happen with my money.. I’m hoping for the best. I’ve super patient, and I have ordered A LOT from here.. I’m hoping for better future experiences but I’m super disappointed and overall feel let down. The prices are going up too, which doesn’t make sense for a lot of the items.. They are honestly about to lose my business unless something changes.\n\nHere is how AliExpress works. They have different “sellers” and “shops” that sell items, nothing is 100% guaranteed.. it really is a gamble with your money because there’s some stores that have fake reviews, and some of the sellers that I’ve come across seem like they try to scam you or trick you so they get money and you’re left trying to figure out how to get your money back.",

    "review": "There are a lot of sales and the discount coupons are very confusing.  I collect a lot of points but don’t use them too much. You never know if you have the one for the store you want.  I usually just don’t buy things because of that. \nThe coupon plus a 0.01 sales  items appear to start at 2 AM here. Needless to say I never get any of them. I guess they aren’t meant for the customers on the east coast or mid western states of the US. It’s the middle of the night here.\nThere is also a problem with items advertising one thing and when you get to the page it’s three or 4 times more expensive for that item. You get a much smaller , scaled down item for the advertised price. Also they will call it cashmere and then when you get to the site and check the specs it says polyester. So I don’t buy that either. That’s illegal in the US. It’s called bait and switch. I’ll go find it elsewhere. It may cost a little bit more but I know for sure what I’m getting.\nWhen I find a good place that has quality items for  a good price I tend to stick with that store. They may cost a few dollars more but I know they are a reputable store and I won’t get junk, it will be something I can use or give as a gift.\nI have bought some very nice things on the app",

Sellers try to make profit from shipping money. Recently I see most items are about the same price or even higher than prices in the US, so shopping on AliExpress & waiting so long to receive the product doesn’t make sense.\n2. Most sellers on AliExpress are Not honest. The pictures you see are Totally different than what you receive. They put nice pictures & send you something cheap & even different & most of the time you cannot dispute it and get refund. There’s no return, even if it was, wouldn’t worth sending it back to China. So far I lost too much money ordering products & received some garbage not even close to the pictures I saw. AliExpress doesn’t prevent it because it makes money but it’s gonna lose customers. I now order on other apps I know I exactly get what I see in pictures based on descriptions.\n3. I didn’t like when they added Tax on purchase but that would be ok if at least I got what I saw on pictures & descriptions not some Chines version of what they showed. \nThere are a few good sellers who send what they show but because Most sellers are cheaters, people don’t trust shopping here.",

    "review": "I was a little skeptical about Aliexpress before i started buying, but let me tell you, Aliexpress is definitely worth a try! Now most of the sellers on Aliexpress are from China or out of country, so i would not go to them if you need your package in a speedy fast hurry, but if your just a heavy shopper like me and forget you buy things when you buy them (lol) packages are always a surprise! on most orders, the estimated shipping say around 89 days, but so far i have place 14 orders in the past week or 2,  and three of them have come in way before estimated delivery. I really like their cart feature, where you can buy one item at a time, or select only the items you want to buy in that purchase. i find it very convenient because on most apps you have to place orders altogether, but with Aliexpress you can pick and choose which items you want to buy. They have feeds where you can check out other people’s reviews about other products, based on the thinks you’ve liked, wishlisted, added to your cart, or searched up which, to me, is a very nice concept. Overall the app is great and i definitely recommend to most <3",

I live in the States and it used to take 1 month or more to get anything from Ali and other similar sites.

Now if I need something name brand very quick, in a day or so I have to hit the normal other shopping sites so I can get an item in a couple days but if you plan ahead just a little and be a little patient you can get some great deals on things, just be smart and check out the seller and feedback and number of sales and star scores and you should be just fine. Ok gotta go, ordering some more stuff from Ali so I can get it before Christmas... \n...are you still here, seriously, did you really read this far?? Good for you, now stop reading and go buy some stuff, hurry, now!!!\nOh yea don’t forget to use the coupons you see on the site and on the sellers page, they will save you a little money which makes it even better!! \nOk by...🤗",

Then since then  the Corona Virus was starting to appear in the US, my seller couldn’t ship the package back to me for some time. I asked for updates every month, because I ordered some other things from China from other apps and they came in. I later asked for a refund in the beginning of June because I no longe wanted the merchandise  and the seller kept telling me she will talk to the courier. Then she wouldn’t get back to me and when she did she told me I will get the refund when the merchandise is returned to them, but my tracking said it was returned to the sender back in April, so I asked her to clarify again. Every time I kept asking for her to update me she said she would check but i never got an answer. Now it is almost August, so this has been ongoing since the beginning of 2020. Then I tried to contact customer service but they don’t have any live people, only bots and they don’t even have a number that I can call for help. So I can’t even contact Ali express but only the seller who is not satisfying my customer service in any way. This was the first time I ordered on Ali express and definitely the last time.",

A few days later, I immediately saw that my purchase was shipped to California and I live at the edge of the East Coast—I’ll let you guess the state. I reached out to the seller and they denied it. We went back and forth sharing pics and tracking until I filed a complaint which took Aliexpress forever to even read the details of the case because this went on for two weeks and before they asked me for screenshots I had already submitted twice.  A long while afterwards, I discovered my identity was stolen and my card info used. I contacted the company to tell them the charges on my account were fraudulent and I was going to report my cards as stolen. When I did so, I got new cards and tried to give the company another chance. This was December when my info was used and I’ve submitted countless appeals and verification requests to prove I am the owner of the cards:sending photo ID, bank states, pics of the cards, my banks’ judgements, and police reports and they still won’t unrestricted my account. They are the most incompetent company I’ve come across. The worst customer service teams. All they do is lie to end the conversation. One star is too good for these con artists. They protect their scammers better than clients. They are a disgusting company who has never reached out to me or my bankers.",

This is don’t for each seller separately. Which is exhausting when you get about 10 packages altogether. They should either allow confirming several packages from different sellers in parallel (by marking with a v in each accepted item which the buyer wants to approve), or add another option after confirming which takes you back to the “shipped” Page, where the confirmation is done.",

They’re exchangeable for coupons (like $2 off $15+ orders) good for very select stores (not all).  Basically, 13% off, which isn’t bad at all except that in the 3 or 4 years I’ve been a very active member, I’ve only used a coin-exchanged coupon like twice. 2) Very limited penny deals in exchange for x-number of gold coins are available every 24 hours. If you’re on the west coast, that’s at midnight. For me on the east coast, it’s at 3am. The one time I tried playing the penny deal, the second it struck 3am, everything was sold out before anyone could count to two. 3) The freebies the sellers advertise, anyone can apply for them and just once from two different offers so you can’t submit a request more than once for one item and you can’t submit more than two requests a day.

    "review": "I’ve been shopping with AliExpress for several years now. The app is pretty decent, sometimes it’s a little clunky but it’s easy enough to navigate around on but I wanted to add my two cents on the reality of shopping here. Think of it like many shops all under the umbrella of Aliexpress, like a mall. It’s a portal to all of these shops and it does offer buyer protection but you have to do your due diligence. First, expect slow shipping because the goods have a long way to travel, slowly. Second, don’t spend anything you are unwilling to lose (do your research, some stores are incredibly safe but there are questionable shops). When you get a package, take a video WHILE you open it. This will serve as proof if the item is damaged or missing parts of the order. And finally, communicate your with seller if there is a problem. Many times they will offer to make things right without intervention, but if things lead to a dispute do not close the dispute and/or accept a refund off of AliExpress. Remember, check reviews, look at photos from buyers, and be smart!",

Some owners purposely keep canceled items until shipping period expires although they don’t wanna ship, which will drive you crazy as your fund is hold until the period expires and cannot be sure to buy from another seller cause you don’t wanna have two.  Cancelled items shipping period should decrease in half unless seller confirm to aliexpress he/she will ship in the original period otherwise its a trap and waste of time of buyers.\nVery few only I came across asking for extra than the published price for shipping. Don't buy from them, either they are cheaters as I said earlier to get on top of search results or they seriously dunno how to count shipping in that case they shouldn’t be selling.",

Up until Aug 22, 2019, I made an order, but cancelled it right away because I’ve used the wrong credit card. Instead of refunding, I got charged. I have spoke to Crissie, customer service, and she was convinced that I was not charged and cannot refund me. I was very upset. I even showed her my bank statement that it was definitely a charge. I know how a charge and a refund looks like. I couldn’t do anything, and she wouldn’t do anything. But instead continuously claim that I wasn’t charge and to rest assure that I will get my refund. So, I have decided to call my bank. They have looked and saw that I did got charge, and there was no reverse for the charge as in there was no refund. So, I had to open a dispute to get my money back. I am upset that she was so convinced I wasn’t charged, and tried to tell me to rest assure that I will get my refund. LIES! Is this how they actually get your money? BUT, even so, this incident won’t stop me from using Aliexpress. I’ve always been loyal to Aliexpress and I will continue to be loyal.",

    "review": "AliExpress auto-confirms receipt of an order, and disables the “Leave Feedback” button after 30 days of auto-confirming a purchase. Fraudulent sellers are taking advantage of this feature to scam naiive and trusting buyers. I made a purchase on Nov 11 and a few days later I noticed the tracking showed shipment was canceled. I contacted the seller and they asked me to be patient that the order will arrive. They seemed nice so I trusted them and kept waiting for it to arrive. I would periodically check back in with the seller after the order still hadn’t arrived and even after three months the seller still told me to keep waiting. By the time I realized I had been scammed and that the seller didn’t actually ship the product, AliExpress had already auto-confirmed the order and the Leave Feedback button had been disabled. I feel so stupid because I now realize this was precisely what the seller wanted — to stall by asking me to wait so that I would neither be able to dispute the order and request a refund, nor leave a review of my experience to make other buyers aware of their scam. This is the reason there are multiple fraudulent scammers on AliExpress platform. Buyers beware!!",

    "review": "I have been using Aliexpress for almost four years.  Unfortunately, they have not improved a lot on how they handle orders that go wrong. Which, for shipments from China to US, happens quite a lot. I have recently dealt with situations where the seller pretends to have an item to sell, then they accept the order, they pretend to ship it and then, after one week, no shipment happens. Or with shipments that get clearly lost in some airport in China. What a normal e-commerce would have in such cases, is a clear communication channel to handle disputes and customer satisfaction. Instead AliExpress uses some robot interface to handle customer requests and when the customer is becoming exasperated he is finally put in a chat with some real customer service person, who usually tells him that the case is being investigated and will get reprioritized. The bottom line is that, even in cases you have not received the merchandise - and you will never receive it - it takes weeks if not months to get your money back. My recommendation is to use AliExpress the least as possible, always use a credit card for purchases (thru AliPay) and at the first sign of wrongdoing dispute the purchase with your credit card company directly.",

You won’t be disappointed and the sellers in the individual stores are always helpful answering any questions about the item prior to purchase. Most items on the site have FREE shipping as well! A+ app! Can’t go wrong with AliExpress. You do have to wait for items to ship from China but it is minimal. Most items arrive within 7-21 days, and again with free shipping in most cases.

AliExpress prices allow me to order needed items and have a sense of security and peace of mind that I can in fact afford them. The very same products sold here sell for twice to about four times as much money if I bought them from American retailers.

That is expected though since it’s being shipped internationally from China, russia or some other foreign far away country. Still, if you want to stock up your closet with great clothes on sale, buy from here. There are some great sellers that offer faster shipping than others. Personally I love shopping from SHEIN; clothes there have great quality, it’s cheaper so you can buy great pairs of clothes in bulk, and shipping takes around a week or so while other stores take up to a month. In this case, when you have a great seller with longer shipping, you’ll have to be patient and switch your strategy while shopping on this app. For example, instead of buying summer clothes during summer, do your fall and winter shopping instead so that you’ll have a whole new wardrobe ready for the upcoming seasons. The same can be done during winter and vice versa. This makes shipping and time no longer an issue.",

It’s ultimately up to you and how much you’re willing to pay (or not pay) for shipping. Some stores even offer shipping within your country so you can get it within days. I honestly believe anyone who complains and cries about having a horrible shopping experience on AliExpress just wasn’t shopping responsibly and smart. Check the stores ratings and reputation.

The user interface is friendly and easy to navigate on the mobile app and it's honestly more convenient. There are always featured deals, as well as a \"For You\" section which localizes your preferences and suggestions. Overall, I'm fascinated with this app and recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind waiting a minimum of two weeks-month for their items.

No where in the website(s) do they even mention or imply is not a natural stone mined in Turkey, or the simple truthful statement “Lab Created”. I found out through a local jewelers of this. Another shop tells a whole story about Zultinite, jewelry and mine. Then advertises Zultinite rings, No mention of its Lab Creation. Yes, these gemstones have identical properties, but that is not the issue. We have every right to know upfront what we are shopping for. It is about buying with confidence and trust. This is called deceptive practice. In US. If I buy a diamond ring that is what I get, Not a Lab created one, unless, I want that instead. No word playing.

Not sure if that’s normal or due to the pandemic. Regardless if it’s something you don’t really “need” and just want it, it’s worth it. Aliexpress also protects its shoppers from sellers that scam or don’t fill orders, as long as you open a dispute in the correct timeframe. Personally I’ve only had to do so once, and the seller was the one who refunded so closed the dispute without Aliexpress getting involved. The only other “bad” thing is sometimes the item gets shipped and then lost. Which again, as long as you open a dispute in the correct time frame you will get your money back.

If you know how to shop, you’ll always get great deals and good quality items!!\nI’ve been on AliExpress for a few years and have made some mistakes. Here is how I’ve managed to get a loot better:\n\n1. When you shop on there make sure you always arrange your searches by most popular/most reviewed so you can see reviews and ratings, as well as items people have mostly purchased (seriously you can see over 1000 buys and reviews for one item:)\n\n2. Do not buy anything unless there are picture reviews. If you do, be cautious. There are products that have over 300 photo reviews so you can go through each photo to make sure it’s what you want. Most products on AliExpress use photos from outside sources that don’t nessasarily reflect the actual product. So photo reviews are really important.\n\n3. When you find a product, scroll down to see if you can find the same one (on the related items) for cheaper. I’ve saved a lot of money looking around. The more you look, the better your chances!\n\n4. Look at the sellers ratings. The higher their ratings, the more legitimate their products are\n\nIt’s about being observant and looking around! Be cautious and pay attention. \nOnce you get the hang of it, Ali is one of the best apps you can have. I’ve saved so much money on items I’d have otherwise bought for twice the price. \nI love AliExpress!!\nHappy shopping!",

Ok I don’t like that manufacturing has been given away to other countries with cheap labor, but since they need jobs too I might as well buy directly from them and save the middle man mark-ups. \n\nThere is a no risk guarantee from Ali Express and they will enforce customer satisfaction. The products I review are only ones I have received.  \n\nI’ve seen pictures of the items sent to others but  some customers are happy with less quality. So look at the pictures carefully and judge for yourself. Only buy if you see a picture of the ACTUAL item. I don’t like that sellers can post pictures from any magazine or designer site, then copy it without posting their own pictures. Often the item looks nothing like the product being sold! I’ve heard of a dog bath arriving that was 3” - for a doll house!\n\nDon’t trust every seller and every product. Learn who is making good products. Some hit and misses, but overall a great opportunity to save money. I have bought things I cannot afford in the US market. Ali Express makes this possible. \n\nFinally, Ali would do well to insist on full refunds when the quality is poor. That way you’ll eliminate the scammers. Some sellers just send junk and get away with it. We cannot get a full refund. Return shipping is almost $100 for dresses - so obviously no one will return anything! Full refunds are necessary.",

I’ve been shopping with AliExpress for many years and had good and bad buying experiences with sellers. \nBad sellers are usually the ones that are scammers  and selling things that aren’t described on their pages such as brand, color, descriptions,  stealing other website’s pics to put on their page, etc. Good sellers are the ones with the legit brands, descriptions that match on their page, and providing you with details. \nI gave it five stars because AliExpress customer support service made shopping online safe, reliable and being fair along  with protection plan. Because if it weren’t for them, I would of loss money and products would not be delivered as promised or an item that I didn’t order was shipped out instead.

I never could find a hair company that had hair that doesn’t shed and feel this great I had this hair for a year and till this day this hair is very soft. I done mad a closure wig with it at first, then into a frontal wig & all i do is reuse this same hair and people will ask me all the time when do I get my hair from and I will tell like this the same hair i had from last year all i did was wash it and it came back to life as soft as you brought it again. Now every year I just buy my hair from this company. I love the price for this hair and everything. This hair is very nice and very affordable.

I bought a hoodie, it was around like 20 dollars, so fair right? I waited around 4 months for it, I ended up contacting the seller since the tracking number and everything just disappeared & wasn’t working. They told me that they would send me another one, but never did. I opened a dispute and discussed the issue with them, again them telling me they would send me the hoodie again and with a new tracking number. However, what ended up happening was they removed the product from their store and ended up just taking my money. I couldn’t open another dispute because they thought I got my product, which I didn’t. I ended up contact AliExpress themselves, getting my money back. \n\nOther sellers are super sweet and actually care about the products they give out, which I greatly appreciate.\n\nHaven't had any other big problems with the app though!",

Some of the items I’ve gotten from AliExpress end up working as described which is great when it does.   The risk is in not being able to predict which products will deliver and which will flop.    \n\nNearly all of products sold on AliExpress are made and shipped from China so delivery time is suuuuuupper sloooooow, like worse than snail slow.   I’m going on seven weeks waiting for purchases I made on AliExpress back in March, and they still show as “waiting for dispatch”, which means they haven’t even left their country yet.  \n\nJust keep these things in mind when ordering from AliExpress:   Products are sold at very attractive prices, but you get what you pay for.

But it wasn’t until recently that I had an issue with an item. And this is the main and only gripe that I have with the site/app. A seller sent me an item that wasn’t as described I messaged the seller and told him that the item wasn’t as it was pictures in the listing. He said it was the same. So I opened a dispute and I uploaded evidence. AliExpress rejected my dispute. I uploaded more pictures and they said they would give me a partial refund I stated I had no use for the item. They wanted to give me $3.57 on an item that cost $19 because they deemed it had value it was just defective. I even offered to return the item if the buyer paid shipping they stated I would have to pay shipping.  But as a customer I didn’t ask for a defective inaccurate item. Why should we as customers get penalized for defective items. As much as I love this site their bad buyer protection really tuned me off and I will no longer order from this site out of fear of getting a defective item. And not be able to get a refund .",

I’m hooked.  I have received everything I have ordered, and the longest I had to wait for a product was 6 weeks.  All products come with tracking.  I have only gotten a couple of defective products and the one product was re-sent and worked fine, and the second was also re-sent but it was defective, so the seller refunded my money.  Both were very friendly exchanges between myself & seller, so it was not a bad experience.

Going back into the entire list and searching by scrolling is very time consuming. The stores you’re following should be able to be sorted alphabetically.

Unfortunately you have to screenshot the conversations almost immediately in case you need them for dispute evidence later on which can be very frustrating.\nFurthermore, I don't like that you aren't able to dispute an order once you've confirmed the goods received. It isn't uncommon for sellers to mess up orders and request that you confirm the goods and leave them positive feedback before they remedy the issue. These sellers back you into a corner and Aliexpress assists them. While you COULD refuse and simply dispute it, often times you'll have to pay some sort of return shipping which can be quite costly depending on what country you're in. It is typically easier to just bite the bullet and work with the company even if it means giving a dishonest review and misleading potential customers.",

Check sizes and dimensions for your own understanding of accuracy. Also understand on clothes that the Chinese are much smaller people so most clothing runs much smaller. What is nice about this app is you can ask the sellers questions about the products if you have any concerns and they will answer you. Overall I think this app deserves a 5 star rating.

I opened a dispute and AliExpress immediately sided with the seller because of the tracking information. As of July 7th, 2019 I still have not received the prop. If a product is lost in transit l, it’s lost and not coming. It’s unfair for the seller to be using that to their advantage. The same thing ended up happening with three other items I purchased. A pair of gauges, a masquerade mask, and a laptop dust cover. \n\nAliExpress also needs to be stricter on what images can be posted for reviews.

Idk if it’s just the seller but I would never receive the bigger items I’ve purchased. Smaller stuff like cellphone case and or small stuffed animals would arrive to me no problem. But bigger items would always be the issue. I’ve always gotten my money back from the seller no problem. Also the tracking most of the seller will have for you track you package is either transit and never moves since it’s never updated or the tracking website would never load the tracking. Which makes it hard to track any item your purchased. I’ll still keep the app to buy the smaller items but more than that it kinda isn’t worth it when I sorta know I’m getting knock out items. Oh for PayPal users just know not many sellers will have the PayPal button.",

I’ve been using this app for over 5 years And the deals can’t be compared. I will warn you, you must shop here when looking for things you do not need right away. The shipping time is longer because items are coming from other countries. You have to plan to shop at least two to three months ahead of time to be prepared for late arrivals. Other items may come within seven days, but it is worth the wait. \n\nThere has only been 6-8 items that I ordered, that were either worthless, didn’t work, or different from what I ordered.

For some reason I’m hooked on trying to get extra points ( coins) with all the little quick games and task even though you never really win what they say. I’ve almost proven that any of their task involving recommending a friend never gives the gifts they say they will and also, I’m coming to find that the “freebies” you can pick twice a day may not be legit either because so far I’ve talked to a few of the stores owners and they have no idea what I’m talking about. I guess I have that one little hope left that I can win a freebie even if it’s wort 25cents. It would so just tickle my pickle for all my hard work and money spent on this site!",

The reviews actually help because you get to see a lot of pictures and they’re all very believable. Sometimes you get what you pay for other times you discover gems where you never expected to find. I love how cheap you can find things for. The ONLY downside is how long you have to wait for products to come in, but at least for me they have always come except for two times and they were both products for like 80 cents. So it’s never really that big of a loss. I wouldn’t buy anything too too expensive though, just to be on the safe side, but I’ve always gotten a refund so that’s also a good thing.

You rarely see your money again- if you’re lucky you might deal directly with the shop owner, and if they are willing to work with you they might send you a replacement product... but in my case, when there was a language breakdown - and Ali began giving multiple shops the wrong address for me (even tho the correct one was clearly stated in my account) I never received ANY of my orders, as they were returned to sender directly from the post office before I was ever notified of their arrival there. The disputes were mostly deemed invalid somehow, and I had no way of fighting this because there was no human to speak to and I lost my money. A lot of it.

If your issue fits within their list of questions, you may have a resolution. Otherwise, you will be stuck in an endless loop which demands that you pose an acceptable question. On two occasions when I was eventually able to bypass Eva, the automated chat, I was assured that my issue would be resolved, only to be ignored. Two months is too long to receive a resolution to a simple issue. If the price of the item that you ordered is not significant, it might be better to abandon any hope of a resolution, and forget about it.

So it is in my best interest to keep track of the items I’ve purchased and learn exactly where they are in the shipping process. Which leads me to where I would greatly appreciate a change. Please let me try to explain. \n\nThe one place where I would greatly appreciate a change would be right after I click ‘Confirm Goods Received’,and be able to go directly back to the exact same place of where I had been before I had clicked on, Confirm Goods Received’.  \n\nUnfortunately, I am sent right back to the top of the page of items shipped, rather than directly to the place I had been before hitting the Confirms button. This leads me to having to scroll all the way back to where I had been before, which can be quite a number of pages down. \n\nIt is so frustrating having to scroll three, four, and even five pages before I can get back to the exact place I had left. I would love to have the ability to go directly back to my spot, so I can continue with following where my items are in the mail or clicking the confirm button. It would definitely save me a lot of time, and it would encourage me to use this part of the app more frequently, along with me giving my feedback to more of the stores. \nThank you for your time.",

You contact the seller and they never replied until your protection time runs out and cannot be refunded. On the other hand when you decide to open a dispute, AE asks you to wait 10 days and after that they will automatically refund you, but when the 10 days are up, they send the same thing and ask you to wait another 10 days. Been trying to contact the customer service for months now every single time a blank page opens up.

Go to the customer support and simply type “i need a human” for a live agent. Because sellers will not talk much or is able to help with the problem once they shipped it!\n\n3. Look at the store ratings. 90% is alright but the higher the better! \n\n4. In disputes it is said that you have to upload an evidence. Read and check your emails to get the full information! Most evidences are usually from your post office!\n\n5. Find other online trackers because the one in aliexpress is bugged/confusing.\n\n6. Try searching your problems on google first whether or not you can trust aliexpress and read some experiences from other buyers! \n\n7. Dont always complain why its not coming blah blah do your part and follow it up! Because packages tend to get lost or broken.

Perhaps I’ve just been lucky, but apart from one parcel that I was refunded for, I’ve received everything I’ve ordered. \nSizes of the clothing is small but “size cm/mm” are generally quoted, so check that out.  \nI’m most impressed by the variety of products, from custom car parts to clothing and beauty products, the stuff is cheap, but well worth the value.  \nOur local Post office charge a fee which is sometimes more then a small order from a single shop on AliExpress, so try order from the same shop, then SA PO consider it one parcel. Otherwise if you order the same items but from different shops on AliExpress they each send you parcels and SA PO charged for each individual parcel. \nSo 4 items from four shops would cost just over R100 but 4 items from 1 shop R25 at SA Post Office.  \nThis is how it works in South Africa.  Not AliExpress’s fault.  Unless they could bundle our orders from different shops and send as 1 order.  \n\nThe points incentive scheme is silly but the “SALE’s” are excellent the items are so cheap that, that in itself is an incentive to buy.  \n\nI suspect any problems to be local (SA) if I look at the tracking facility available on the APP, SA Customs is slow to release items.  \n\nLove shopping on AliExpress.",

    "review": "AliExpress is a good place for shopping, but  as for user experience and products shipment tracking theres alot to improve also the shipping choices as a user I don't see if it matters to me unless time and price is gonna affect. Moreover the seller direct contacting with you is not really that good neither important! The most important thing for me is to find the item is available and counted! Two items not received because there's no proper counting for products and it was finished.\nAlso need to make someone in middle to handle all issues and concerns for a better experience.\nAnyway I'm happy with items I bought and its prices. But as I said it was frustrating to deal with dealers and the tracking is sooo slow and not accurate.\nFinally the whole user experience needs re-engineering and put clear and simple indications on website and mobile app.",

I asked for a refund. In order to do a refund I had to go cancel my order. I selected cancel order>select reason why> seller doesn’t have it. When I did this I get a message from the seller asking me to change my reason for cancelation or I won’t get my refund. I think the seller deserves a bad rating because they strong armed me into canceling it because >buyer doesn’t want it anymore. This now makes me think how many more buyers have gone through what I have? I think the reason why there are so many good ratings of the sellers on AliExpress is because they blackmail. In order to get your refund, the seller asks for a cancelation that  doesn’t hurt their rating. Also AliExpress doesn’t accept PayPal, which takes more time to get my money back and less safe of a purchase. I don’t think I’m going to use AliExpress unless they change a few things.",

However recently a lot of vendors have infiltrated this app and aliexpress seems to willfully turn a blind eye and refuses to accept factual proof pointing to scamming and dirty vendors. If a vendor contacts you after you have purchased something and they accepted your order to give them more money for shipping or bs covid claims, DO NOT DO IT!!! IT IS A SCAM!!! These practices are 100% illegal. Report them immediately to Aliexpress as well to anywhere else that has aliexpress communities (ie reddit fb etc) . I once believed AliExpress had our best interest at heart but after my several reports of illegal and fraudulent vendor behaviors ignored i just dont know how much longer i feel comfortable backing this marketplace. It’s sad, but we have to watch out for our fellow consumers. Dont give into scams,it hurts us all! I would say sorry AliExpress but youve decided to put me in a corner i tried very hard to make you aware of. I trusted you, now im paying the consequences and you STILL refuse to listen.",

It’s just a little hard getting through a live person. \n\nIf item is damaged it’s hard to get a refund with picture. If seller is nice they will give a partial refund even if you are not planning to use the damaged item. I guess it’s better then nothing. \n\nSometimes seller marks it as shipped then for some reason when you check your tracking it shows as cancelled. If item was cancelled for no reason all you have to do is take a snap shot of cancelled screen as proof and dispute it or contact a live customer representative to get a refund. \n\nAnother thing is while some sellers are nice and honest, there are a few that are questionable. I’m not sure if it’s because they do not understand English. I was told they would get back to me about why my order was cancelled but they never got back to me. Thankfully customer service helped me with my refund. I gave it 3 stars because of customer service and a few sellers. Other then that I would rate it 1 star. \n\nAlso it takes long for most sellers to ship out your item. If you don’t mind 1-2 months of waiting and praying you will get your item then this is for you. But there are a few sellers (very few that I came across) that ship really fast. I’m not sure it’s worth the wait and stress hoping that your item will actually arrive.",

I highly recommend AliExpress.  The best thing is that the money is held in escrow until you verify you received your complete order.\nHere are some tips:\n1. I  make sure to order from vendors who have a high rating\n2 I also check the number of orders the vendor had processed.\n3. Once you pay for your order, keep track of the processing time And when the order was shipped.  There is a count down on the maximum number of days an order should take to get to you.   If you're clock runs out and your have not received your order, you are SOL.  If you're clock is running out and you have not received your order, you can extend the clock but you must do this before the clock completely runs out.  \n4.  If  you accidently order something in your sleep (as I have done) you can cancel the order is it is still in the processing mode.  I also message the vendor along them to cancel the order and I also dispute the charge it I don't have my money back in a week.\nThis sounds like a daunting task but l have had some great experiences and ordered a ton of items over the years.   \nGood luck.",

It is one of those places you have to really read(and leave) reviews to help others out.

A little frustrating but when you’re buying things like phone chargers or cute jewelry for under $3, hello it’s worth it!

And the fact that they allow such things to be markedly on their app caused them to lose me as a customer. There’s a lot of scammers stealing everyone’s clothing and selling it as there own, there’s also a lot of white powder and weed like substances being sold up their as well recently.

You can pay for expedited shipping and they’ll still ship the slowest way to save money. This is a hustle for most of the sellers.  ALIEXPRESS needs to hold them accountable and only allow verifiable resources sellers on this site, not anybody trying to make a quick buck by posting a blazer, yet mailing a wash rag. Shipping should improve & the quality of the item you post should be exactly what we receive. Stop using the same cheap fabrics and actually produce quality products.",

I’ve found you need to order more than $5 from a vendor for PayPal to work consistently. That can be an inconvenience as even though all items are placed in your cart, they are separated by seller and each store must be paid individually. Even with this slight inconvenience I am still happier with the selection and pricing on AliExpress.

That’s why, please when you purchase something and receive it later. Write a review truthful review with a picture as well. It helps people why more and puts us at ease knowing that the product is either good or bad. Most of the products that Ive bought came in in good condition but there are some touch up here and there that I need to fix. But over all a good app.",

    "review": "Aliexpress’ customer support is worthless.\nI payed for three digital multimeters during their 11/11 sale that were sold with free shipping.  The vendor then demanded an additional $32 to ship the meters.  I contacted Aliexpress customer support three times.  The first two times they “assured” me that my meters would be shipped without me paying extra money.  The vendor then got a shipping number, but  still did not ship the meters.   I contacted Aliexpress again and asked for a refund.  They said they would not give me one, because the vendor had “shipped” the meters.  However there is a long record of messages between the fraudulent vendor and my self detailing his demands for more money, and that he has not shipped the meters.  When I said I would file a complaint with my credit card company, they said they would fight it because the meters were “shipped” so I should just wait weeks for their “process.”.  \n\nI filed a complaint with my credit card company and explained the situation, including the long string of email messages I have with the additional demands for more money and the non-shipment.   They advised me there would be no issue since I have the email and screen shot records.\n\nAliexpress has full access to the messages between the vendor and myself, but they refuse to consider them because is not part of their “process.”  Thus their customer service guaranty is worth less than a steaming pile of dog excrement.",

I have had only very bad experience from a seller who was very rude to me and I had a dispute open for 3 months for  item that I never received and they refused to give me my money back for a 15$ fitness watch I was so disappointed and upset but you live and you learn . I will never buy from that seller again . I hope no one does because it was a disaster.

This is definitely something to invest in if you’re trying to setup your business or even buy alternative items when you’re on a budget. Either way I’d recommend this app to anyone even if it wasn’t for the same purpose. \n\nIt’s user-friendly and definitely a good competition if we were to compare it to other apps such as Wish. However, I’m in no means attempting to shame the other company to persuade anyone else reading this to download this app. I just have strong beliefs that I feel we should all be open-minded about when it comes to providing effective feedback for the creators. \n\nYes, every application will have its flaws. However, I feel this app suits my needs the most more than another application which is why I’m recommending this. I was not paid to say any of this and I would definitely consider AliExpress in my list of useful applications.\n\nAliExpress has done a very good job of providing everyone with an opportunity to grow businesses. Therefore, I applaud the founders and wish their tech team the best! Please keep up the great work and continue to amaze us with all you do!",

The app is organized, and has a clean look to it. The one thing I wish the would change is how fast the product videos play. Usually I have to wait a minute or two before it starts to play. I don’t normally mind waiting but sometimes the app crashes if I have to wait for too long. Another thing that would make a better shipping experience is if there was more different kinds of products that appeared on your dash board. I usually get a lot of the same stuff from different sellers popping up, and I’d really like to see some more variety. All in all, I am very happy with this app! 🌸💕",

My package has been missing for a month until I opened a dispute and all they keep telling me is to WAIT because packages might be delayed. The problem is that the package reached my post office already but has never been scanned Delivered (which obviously means it hasn’t been delivered). I tried everything before I opened up this dispute. I went to the post office to see if I could pick it up but they told me it was not there and they’ll contact me for any new information (it’s been over a month). I filed a USPS lost package claim in which they CONFIRMED THAT MY PACKAGE HAS GONE MISSING AND THEY DON’T KNOW WHERE IT IS. Aliexpress is siding with the seller on this telling me to wait for a package THAT IS NOT COMING and I don’t know if I will get another chance to dispute. I feel for the seller as it is not their fault in this however, I PAID for an item that will NEVER arrive. Disappointed.",

I sent them the front of my ID with most details edited out only showing my name and the front and back of my credit card with only the last four of the number showing, everything else marked out.

I have also seen some sellers post comments as if they have received a order with fake pictures and all so be careful!!! I’ve used AliExpress for years because sometimes the cheap route is easier. Sellers also will take a long time to ship your order and one threatened me they wouldn’t give my money back unless I said for my reasoning “other reasons” so Again I say there are more scams than deals on this site after experience. Best bet is to ask someone you know about a product or someone real who has left review after a couple months.",

I guess this is what happens when you deal with people who don’t read and understand English well enough before assuming the customer is wrong.

I’ve really gotten my aesthetic together with the stores and products I’ve found on this app. Again, these things are all incredibly inexpensive. The only downside of ordering from AliExpress is that the products can potentially take a while to arrive. In my experience, the product will arrive around the time the app says it will, which can be up to roughly a month or two. It’s worth it to me, though!! :-)",

We purchased everything from electronics to wedding dresses that needed measurements taken and we’ve been constantly impressed. \n\nOf course you should do you home work. Only buy from sellers in China, know when the Chinese Holidays are, and when you find a great seller continue to use them. But really many have been great. Check prices too, but AliExpress has done a great job keeping price competitive while other apps charge outrageous prices. For the first time in over 5 years I’m getting a lot of bad sellers. I’m pretty much down to only using certain sellers now, but bad sellers caused my rating to drop one star. The app, however, does offer some levels of protection and handling disputes.\n\nBest buying app in the iTunes Store!",

I have bought clothes and had hit or miss but it’s expected at such discounted prices. The goods mostly all ship from China. Some items have US shipping options but not all. Chinese shipping is typically FREE but does take 3 weeks-2 months for certain items to reach you. \n\nI have bought certain “branded” items and they are dupes made with different materials with low quality print designs so definitely don’t expect Prada to be Prada (which I never did) but the items can still be super fun & you might luck out with super nice things if you do research!! :3 \n\nPhone cases are good typically — makeup can be hit or miss.

Not all, but most of those sellers add a huge amount of shipping cost to Each item you add on, even though you already pay a chunk for the first item, and the additional items are tiny.   I understand you would add in a bit more as weight went up, but usually, if I bought say $50 in purse hardware parts (a pretty small amount in volume) my shipping would be at least $35.  And the parts were not cheap to start with!  If I ordered one set of something, shipping would be $6 or $7 about.  If I added a second, and so on, it would often be another $4 or so on average.  This is SO MUCH BETTER!!!  Thank you!!",

You definitely have to be careful who you buy from, if the store doesn’t have any reviews, go to their store page and see if other people’s orders came as described!!! If a store doesn’t have reviews on ANY of their products or they have repeat reviews, do not buy from them because you can get scammed. A lot of people complain of being scammed but tbh they just didn’t use their common sense or do enough investigating. Also, people will leave bad reviews on hair, but don’t even know how to comb it, embarrassing but yea STOP! The ONLY problem is the shipping. It takes FOREVER to come y’all. But it’s worth it.

So I try to contact the seller and they only send a ‘thank you’ automated response. I open a dispute case to receive my money back and cancel the purchase order. the seller rejected my petition and it has been 2 months since that dispute and until this date the company hasn’t been able to contact me about it and I just feel that there’s no support on their end. So basically just make sure the seller is honest, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive the product or that you’ll get your money back.",

They are providing tracking that may or may not be true to beg you to not file a dispute.  After the dispute window is over you never hear from the seller again.  You lose your money and no one knows the order is.  I think dispute time frame should have been extended for all March and april orders.  I lost a very large order like this.

They invalidated my request, because they extended the delivery time to another 2 months, without even bothering to ask me whether I agree to it or not. 4 months delivery!!! What?? That’s insane.

Coins are a nice thing when you use them on items and get two cents per coin but you have to use a ridiculous and childish system to “collect” them which is demeaning and silly.\n\nAnother issue is that almost all ships other than the ones run by truly good and smart owners engage in habitual lying and theft regarding what they sell and the way they showcase their items. Photoshop use is rampant and unpunished. Search pricing is absolutely not reflective of the final price - they can list another option which is something unrelated to the item sold in order to make the item appear to cost less aT first glance. In addition many stores use fake shipping costs to double or triple the cost in a way that is difficult to notice and that results in you losing your shipping costs when you inevitably return their defective items.\n\nTry to buy exclusively from stores rated 96-97% and higher. Even better is to buy only from stores which have a clear management structure and presence outside AliExpress. Find shops which eschew cheating. \n\nNote to AliExpress: you must create some sort of simple reporting feature for mislabeling etc. It’s abhorrent how rampant cheating and theft are on your platform.",

My suggestion to the company is to invest money in working to fix those issues because these kind of complains are everywhere and your response of “this page is intended for 18 years or older” doesn’t help in any way.

Not worth it. \nAs for the freebies, these are intended to spur feedback on product for others. Except, they’ll only approve and publish your review if they like it, so the idea of honest feedback it out the window. Not to mention there are thousands of people all trying to register for a chance at one item. You hardly ever win.

All issues are taken care of quick if there is a problem with the item or if it doesn’t show. Items can be hit or misses, but if you use your best judgement and pay attention to reviews on there, you’re good to go. \n\nJust don’t bother with the daily entries for winning “free” items. I actually won one of the items and instead of free they put the full price of the item into the shipping of it which I was still expected to pay. Not sure if it’s the same for all items of if that specific seller was doing that, but that was my only experience with that section of the website.",

Getting a hold of customer service is not as easy. However, contacting the seller is. Not happy with the pictures of items purchased be taken down. Sometimes I would like to remember what I had purchased. Which purse since descriptions could be similar to another. Saving items to your wish list is kind of a waste since they might not be there tomorrow. Half of the items saved to my list is discontinued or no long shows up. Picture of items should at least stay online and marked as discontinued. I still have much to learn about the app.",

Once you start clicking on stuff from store to store I had to keep hitting the back button to get back to the main search screen. I didn’t realize that the home icon was hidden in a sub menu. That should be clearly marked so people know. It took me a couple months to figure that out. Maybe I’m just dumb? Anyways it’s really easy to find stuff aT great deals and easy to navigate within the different store. I use to order my Chinese stuff on eBay and wish. Not any more!!

What I love about the app is the shipping companies have a timed window to have your order shipped and received or you will be automatically refunded. Shipping waits can be a little long depending on what you order, but that is understandable due to COVID and shipping demands right now. This app is also very convenient for people who like to sell products due to the prices being very reasonable and the seller being able to make a decent profit!!!!

I can’t use any of my select coupons! I have $18 in select coupons, and none of them show up in checkout. I’m buying an item from a seller that accepts the select coupons and I’m spending more than the required amount, but no select coupons in the checkout. Even more frustrating, is that the select coupons come up just fine on that same order on the PC website version. Only the order is more expensive off of the website. So, yeah, not happy... The other glitch is that when leaving feedback, if you try to leave too much the app kicks you out. I ordered a number of little things from a seller and couldn’t leave feedback through the app for this reason. Please fix it.",

It is a trusted site if an item takes to long to send or you never recieved an item you can make a dispute and they will refund you the money. Only problem is some items may take months to arrive but they will come so anything you are ordering for an event please consider that fact. Many of the items are from out the country so thats why shipping takes is a while. Clothes and shoes are about the same quality you would buy clothes from forever 21, fashionnova, and other boutique stores. For the price i feel this sit is wonderful really if you are trying to start your own business like selling hair, eyelashes, lip gloss, clothes or shoes.",

I uploaded the pictures from our house camera to show the day the shoes were supposedly delivered the mail carrier was only at our mailbox for 5 seconds. So our mail carrier is a superhero, they can put mail shove 2 pair of shoes in mailbox in 5 seconds. After going back in forth with AliExpress CUCULUS SATURATUS they said “NO REFUND!!

Now it lets you continually add items to the bag but only 60 show and the others will appear only when you delete some of the 60 that show. I’d rather it go back to the 99 items and not let you add any more rather than to add many items & they reappear after some are deleted.\n\nWhen paying for orders the payment screen just loads & loads so I didn’t know if I placed an order & was timid to hit the close button because I didn’t want my card to be charged twice. \n\nAdding the tax to items may have been required by law but this steers me away from making purchases. Maybe have the taxes included in the price of the items so we won’t be surprised when going to the order confirmation screen. Or, provide more discounts for the items. \n\nThe tracking information doesn’t show the actual status any more for most of my orders. I don’t want to have to go to the actual sites to track the packages & see the status when the app has provided the status of the tracking in the past. \n\nPLEASE FIX!",

I don’t buy clothing or shoes here but I’ve bought one shirt from here and it’s one of my favorite shirts. But I don’t recommend using AliExpress to buy all your shoes and clothing. If so, READ reviews. There is a lot of duplicate brands, so if you buy a “name brand” item, it’s probably off brand so just read the description carefully. I come on here a lot to buy random things and it’s been great. anyways, I haven’t had a bad experience with AliExpress, other than the shipping is pretty long but that’s expected.",

I was disappointed with a necklace set I ordered since it didn’t come with each necklaces separately clasped. I also ordered T-shirts in a size medium and they fit like an xsmall. I ordered something for my friend who just graduated and they gave me a refund since apparently the seller didn’t ship it out in time? Lots of questionable things about this app. Do NOT recommend",

I have used all of mine and it’s not enough with the massive variety of products available!  Particularly because I shop for myself and my business.  Why limit it when sellers will just sell more!   I also think the shipping costs should be provided as a single line item and not per item in checkout.  My guess is both sellers & and Ali-Express are losing out on shipping upgrade revenues because you are basically penalized if you purchase a lot of items and want to pay more for faster shipping.  Otherwise, it’s a fabulous!!!  The app itself is excellent!",

So to make this app better maybe take the shipping price down a bit! But overall there are things that are free shipping! I recommend it if you don’t have a lot of money and you don’t want to buy a 100 dollar thing",

I haven’t had any problems with the app. The problems I have had have been with a couple of dishonest sellers. But I have ordered from at least thirty or more different sellers. All but the two have been honest and courteous and very helpful if there was a problem. The other two I had to open disputes over shortages in merchandise. However AliExpress backed me and I was issued refunds. I would never reorder from those sellers. But as I said, all the other ones are awesome and do a great job. Thanks for everything AliExpress!!",

Most items reach the U.S. within 2 to 3 weeks. Items shipped from the U.S. are often delivered only a few days after ordering. I have not had many issues with items I have ordered but the sellers have been very easy to work with the few times I have had a problem. I believe payment is withheld from the seller until an item is marked received so I am conscious about marking shipments received as soon as they arrive.",

That being said, there are a lot of things to toggle through so that get’s a little confusing and when you do check out, prices fluctuate from the posted discount prices to the full price. Then the discounts apply later and it that also gets confusing. I do wish that when you made a purchase already and waiting for it to be delivered, that the product prices would reflect the purchase price and discounts that were applied at initial checkout. Promos come and go and I’m looking for easier ways to compare prices and remembering how much I paid for an item initially.",

Also can they stop making everything in that cheap polyester material everyone can’t wear polyester, and they would probably get more sales and better reviews if the quality of their clothes were better. Some are charging $20+ dollars for clothes and the material only makes them worth $10 that’s kind of a rip off that’s one reason why I had stopped ordering on here bc everything that’s reasonably priced is cheap looking.",

The time to shipping is highly variable from vendor to vendor.  \n\nAliExpress should enforce quicker time to shipping of its vendors.  The time to shipping is from the time the order is placed until the vendor actually ships the item.  Perhaps vendors need to provide quantity in stock parameters.\n\nThe second issue I have is regarding truth in product description.  AliExpress needs to set rules for vendors products descriptions.  For example, products advertised as genuine leather should not include synthetic materials including PU leather.  This is to the benefit of all parties, AliExpress reputation, vendors who are actually selling genuine leather products, and AliExpress customers who want to know what they’re buying.",

I appreciate the tracking capability, how easy it is to leave feedback and photos, and how easy it is to communicate with seller. I also appreciate seeing other user reviews and their pictures. IMHO, this is THE best app i have—for any purpose—bar none. Completely user-friendly, yet jam packed with options. It lacks absolutely nothing. As far as the products go, I have purchased many many items from AliExpress and have NEVER been disappointed, EVER. And no one can beat the prices. BRAVO Ali express; well done!

There is no automated message saying that they will not be able to ship for weeks at a time. Very frustrating to deal with overseas people. Much easier to go through LA we are surprises on hand!!!",

I still have a chance to receive it with ANGERS. It all depends on how smart the delivery agent/guys.

They sent the photo, which was not like the stock photo, so I tried to cancel, and they refused to. I contacted support and they said to wait until I received the shoes to dispute it. So I finally received the shoes... made of the incorrect materials, RIPPED, and even somehow wrinkled and dented, with some kind of plastic bag visible inside the shoe platform. I opened a dispute... and have now been waiting days for a response. Why waste my time making me wait months to dispute it when I knew the shoes were incorrect from the start?? And even despite these issues, there’s no guarantee I’ll get a refund.\n\nAliExpress is great for items with lots of reviews.

Ive always shopped on AliExpress but recently Ive had an issue where I didn’t receive an order I paid around $20 for. Obviously the seller continued to lie and refuse to give me a refund and AliExpress hasnt helped me whatso ever. I dont have any proof photographically and thats all they want. The product never was received in MY mailbox but I cant proof it in a photo. I even called the local post office and they gave me a number to confirm that It wasn’t received but that doesnt matter since Im required to show some kind of photo. Ive never been more upset about this and Im most likely never ordering anything again. You lost a customer that has been loyal for years now. I do not recommend this app unless youre willing to lose money at some point.",

The transactions went smooth and never had any issues using the app and placing orders. I can chat with the seller to find out more about the products. There are some that does not respond quickly and some does. I did benefit with some coupons that pops up on my app like $10 coupon that i can use which i think is awesome. Just a tip if you will buy somthing just do a thorough research with the product before you buy and as well the seller’s rating. Hope this helps!",

The only bad thing is that sometimes the shipping can either take a month or two or it can take a couple days. Just plan ahead if you’re ordering something just in case. They're really helpful with returning things. Just use common sense because sometimes the clothes might be too small or it's not exactly how it is in the pictures so always check the reviews but other than that the app is perfect and I always come here to buy stuff.",

The rest of the marketplaces are just cheap carnivals.\n\n After a few years and hundreds of orders I figured to go big, because I was intimidated by the sheer size of this entity. Thousands and thousands of vendors, thousands and thousands of customers, billions of transactions. And I am not a fan of promotional hype, because in my experience it ends in you spending more rather than saving. \n\nAliExpress has a smooth escrow service, payments are quick, you can communicate with vendors freely and support chat is 24/7 with a real human. But my god, the promotions and customer reward system clutters the UI and is also confusing. You get coupons that say “$10 off” but then it turns out to be 5 $2 coupons, valid with select vendors products. \n\nIf AliBaba closed the gates on its hype machine, AliExpress would be much smoother.",

Which doesn’t seem bad on the outside, but on AliExpress sellers 95% or lower will rarely come to you as described, or at all. So if you shop smart, this is a great place! The quality only depends on your choice of seller. The app is great!",

I contacted seller , he said he will send me another one. Second order in June 3020. Still waiting to receive, nothing after 3 months. I paid twice for the shopping cost. Contacted seller again. He said he will send another order. Paid again for shipping cost. Finally received in October. Wrong color . I received orange color instead of brown deluxe. I asked my money back from seller, nothing. I contacted support 3 times, with detailed report, nothing. I contacted seller again, he replied with a smile. No support from Ali Express at all. I spend 108 euros plus 49 euros taxes, for nothing!!!",

The products are almost always as described and if anything you could always check out customer reviews (if available) so that you can see what you’ll be buying beforehand. The service team is always super fast to solve an issue if presented with one but I’d say that for the prices you can’t really complain, you definitely do get more for what you pay which is just awesome!

The email shipping tracking is of no use as the tracking email does not described what is being tracked except for a number. With this i would have to go back into the app and review my purchases and located what item is still in transit.  It would be much easier if the tracking email also included item description or the name of the item.\n\nAlso Ali Express defective return or item not received policy is not so efficient as the process of getting an item replaced or credited takes a while and the seller makes the buyer repay again and say they change the price to 1c after you place the order and still the buyer has to pay 1c on their charge card.  Totally ridiculous.\n\nThe looks of Ali Express website looks attractive but needs lots of work in the search department.  \nI enjoy shopping at Ali Express and hope to see their website improve in the future.",

I also love the “freebies” and “coupon pals” sections. Those are both experiences I haven’t seen before in a shopping app, making AliExpress feel very fresh. The direct communication in the app between buyers and sellers is laid out well.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to allow customers to use emoji when communicating in reviews or conversations with sellers. Emoji help out when the auto-translations aren’t fully accurate 🛍👟💱📦🏷😊",

If you have a problem with something, they will just refund your money, and forget having to ship it back. \nNearly everything works as promised, they just are not genuine products; merely highly re-engineered copies.

    "review": "I am mostly satisfied with the the service I’ve received from AliExpress over the years. \nI am a platinum member and they have always been cooperative and expedient with issuing refunds back to me whenever I’ve had to open a dispute because an order I made never arrived in the mail and/or did arrive but was damaged. \nThe only complaint I would have is that I’ve noticed most items now include shipping charges, when in the past, most items came with free shipping. I find this to be quite disappointing because one of the reasons I’ve made so many orders with AliExpress was because of the free shipping along with very reasonable prices, which reminds me that I’ve also noticed that the prices on many of their items have also increased. \nI’d be curious to know why the increase in prices along with shipping charges. \nThank you in advance for the great service, I look forward to a reply. \n\nV/R,\nMelody Hughes",

However, some of them was so rude and required me to pay for return fee while they said free return before I make the order. Others asked me to return but gave me only 3 days for the processing while so live in America and I must take like a month to return the item. I even check the customer service of AliExpress too but doesn’t work at all. That make me feel worried whenever I want to buy something this website coz I don’t know if the goods are as pictures or it will be so bad and they won’t refund money for me.",

It’s definitely addictive I should say because it’s a huge stress buster for me to do “online window shopping!!” And ofcourse sometimes actually shopping !! I add atleast 2 items each day to my cart and the moment my cart reaches its limit, I reduce it by buying the items that I lived the most in the cart! It’s definitely affordable and more cheaper compared to any other online shopping websites and the best part is it can be shipped easily to any part of the world!",

I would be willing to pay a modest shipping to get my items quicker. Ive had some credit card fraud problems so I only pay with PayPal. Wish all your sellers took PayPal.\nWhen I report an item wasn’t received, I’d like to be taken more seriously.",

I appreciate the savings on items coupons and recommendations. Messsge buyers with questions and inquiries they may have what your looking for. Thanks Ally nice site service and products. A+",

The deals are phenomenal, and the quality has always been good, often better than or just as good as costume jewelry at popular American stores (Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, Claires) for a fraction of the price. \n\nThe lack of additional shipping charges on most items makes it even better, and sometimes purchasing via the app instead of the website yields additional discounts. For example, I made 7 jewelry purchases totaling $16 and it got me 5 necklaces, 3 chokers, 2 pairs of earrings, and an elaborate two piece ring. \n\nMany items also have picture reviews from customers, and you can ask questions directly to vendors to make sure you're getting what you think you are.\n\n5/5 I would definitely recommend.",

One of the sellers I tried to contact just ignored my messages and the other replied with a message saying “your order has been on the road.

After 4 months of waiting, The manufacture said “ your parcel may be lost by post office”, the tracking Infor showed it has not even left China. I filed a dispute for a refund. Two full month later nobody is doing anything about it. My money are gone. This is how Mr. Ali got rich. He charges you full amount upfront ( you are basically advancing him cash, free of interest, for 3-4 months, in my case - 7 months), and when a manufacture “looses” your shipment, Mr. Ali disappears, together with your money . Well, I paid a price for a lesson. Buying from AliExpress is a gamble , all depends how much you are prepared to loose. Just keep in mind that there is NO consumer protection in this set up .

I submitted a dispute over the extreme amount of time for shipping and they allowed it to happen. Yes, I finally got the items but I am choosing not to purchase anything else due to AliExpress’s choice to not support the purchaser. It shouldn’t take 3 months for anything to ship in this world right now. eBay and other sites can provide what I purchase within days not months for about the same price.",

Be careful when sellers offer epacket delivery (which is the fastest , 12-20 days), especially when they offer it free because they may scam u like Wow-Fashion and ship it China post which takes forever. When you contact customer service about it they cease to condemn or reprimand these seller scams and redirect you to report these frauds only to get your support ticket denied because they “didn't violate policy”. Yes, basically AliExpress defends scammers. So buy at your own risk and dont expect timely delivery for products u may need ASAP through epacket because there is no buyer protection period.

AliExpress continues sending me to check the USPS or ask if someone got my package which thats not my job.

I wanted a refund because myy items have yet to move (they are still in the same place I ordered them in October) and I was told I can’t because they were already shipped when they weren’t ! Once I receive myy last 3 packages I’m definitely deleting",

The advertising is minimally intrusive and is easy to get around. It also give you options for different warehouse locations (if multiple) from which to ship your items, so you can pick and choose which country you would like to get products from to minimize shipping time.

I have definitely had some things that I never received, but that really is more rare, maybe only like 2% of the time. There is no recourse at that point because it’s usually past the date by the time I can call attention to it. \n\nOverall though, I really like the option of being able to order some things that are much less expensive And  I would not have been able to afford in the US.\n\nUpdate: in recent months, shipping speed has really picked up and I am feeling more confident now with ordering from Ali express.",

I bought a handbag from Macy's for $79 and a few days later I happen to see the same handbag on this app for only 9 bucks!! I definitely returned the other one! Also my other order arrived in such good and safe packaging 😍 The shipping was pretty fast too that I didn't expect at all. I absolutely would give more than 5 stars 🌟 The only thing is that you should be careful with the sellers. Great great great.",

The service is great and friendly, and the shipping is one of the fastest I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing. Even if you have a bad experience with a store, your money can and will be returned to you. You could even find another store altogether that will be more than happy to fulfill your order! \n\nDefinitely recommend AliExpres!",

The choices you have for a dispute do not reflect the problem of having your order completed with receiving merchandise and if you pick any of the choices provided they deny your dispute . Honesty is the best policy if the customer knows up front that there will be a longer delay they can make the decision to order or not",

It spends a lot of bandwidth trying to sell me dresses and other women’s clothing and very little time on the men’s shoes, shorts, and electronics that I’m interested in. Sorry, but I have no intention to EVER buy a dress, yet it never learns. \n\nReminds me of the days that men would turn off the TV when they couldn’t handle being bombarded by feminine hygiene commercials.\n\nIronically, be careful not to accidentally click on something you don’t want. Although it won’t let you say what you don’t want, it is very quick to show you alternatives for years to things you do click on, even after you bought one and don’t need another.",

Another problem is, when I refreshed the cart page, the items that were previously added there were removed (I didn’t click to remove, the app did it itself). Please fix it soon. Thank you :)",

I’ve had 2 items I liked and the rest of the purchase were completely different from the description, some clothing items came torn, different materials than describe (thin, very easy to rip)I purchased 4 body chains 5 months ago and I’ve contacted and continue to contact the seller. There unresponsive, I just receive computerized messages that have nothing to do with the things I’ve asked or say. \n  This is a very poor company whom really catches your eye don’t fall for it !

Some vendors don’t ship until they get close to the deadline to ship which causes delays in the receipt of goods.  If you are willing to wait for product, the prices are great.  Quality on most items received are quite satisfactory.  It would be helpful if all vendors would picture their fabrics with a ruler, so customer can gauge if the size of the pattern is appropriate for what they are making.",

Don’t skip that! It will show you what the item is really like and whether it’s worth buying. All in all I enjoy using AliExpress over Wish or EBay for nail supplies as there is SO much variety!",

Remember they are overseas and they rarely describe products appropriately. You can ask them beforehand and they can outright lie to you. You may receive an empty package, the wrong item, cheap quality or broken items and guess what? Yep you’re out the money. Don’t even consider filing a dispute with your bank unless you want to be banned permanently from AliExpress so in other words you are the rich wealthy westerners whom should accept the financial hit.

You could make good money reselling some of the items. Only downside is the looong delivery time for free or standard shipping, about 2 months. But who am I to complain about a good bargain, right? Also you can get discount coupons. For example you buy $5 worth or more and get $4 off the total. Now that’s a good deal!",

I highly recommend this app to anyone that buys online and you won’t be disappointed!!!",

Sometimes it will take a month or so to receive your items but every now and then you’ll find a vendor that ships super fast and you’ll get your items in 2 to 3 weeks!

But recently, April 15th of 2020 I placed an order for some belts. 3 belts from the same company to be exact and they never show up. Tracking is obviously fake cause they barely never had clear information in the delivery updates. Can’t be track while it was in delivery but only showed up as delivered while the package never came. So I did what a normal person would do, put in a dispute and wait. And the “case manager” dismiss the dispute and rule that there’s nothing they can do to give me a refund. I can’t appeal the result either and can’t contact a single REAL human being for the problem I had. Just UTTERLY stupid ruling and judgement from a computer. \n\nBTW: the SELLER store is called Little Fortunate Store. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. \nWith that type of name I should’ve known.",

If you adhere to this rule you shouldn’t face any problems, and aside from sometimes having long wait times, there are no other downsides. Overall I recommend!!",

Halfway through our messages the person helping me switched to Portuguese mid sentence for no reason. \nWhen I finally was able to open the dispute case, the seller tried to low ball me on how much I got back, and then wouldn’t give me a full refund even though it was THEIR fault, not mine.",

Sellers constantly use the same stock photos, yet the products themselves vary in quality depending on the seller. If you can sift through the junk listings, you can get good quality products at great price. Shipping can be a nightmare and sometimes takes months. Although it can be challenging to find a good seller, they are out there. I have found a few good ones. They have good quality packaging, 30 day shipping, and great customer service.",

For example, I received a low dollar OTF knife which TRACKING says is not yet possible to track yet and will be delivered between Sept. 10th and 29th.  BAM ! It came today August 13th.\nThey do play games with descriptions, particularly automatic knives ! My “No Name” knife from today’s arrival is a handful of automatic with the double sided dagger FLYING out and retracting with major force !\nI suspected it was OTF automatic from the pictures but NOT from the description.\nUnder $20 delivered, so I’m more than satisfied and just ordered 3 more for gifts.\nSearch around diligently, order an inexpensive Kershaw and make your own mind up about ordering Chinese steel and MANY top brands !",

Any issues and they have always been resolved by the dispute process.

This has happened to me so many times and I have try to get in touch with AliExpress and they have deleted they number and email. They only have the Robot and it doesn’t even respond to you at all. I have to call me bank and pay extra money to get my money back. Just because how you pick those vendors.",

Example:  If the current delivery status is at “Accepted by airline,” estimate day maybe 5 day to California\n\nI am trying to send in my comment, it asks for my nick name.  It reject 4 times because the nick name was taken.  This is not very helpful if not discouraging users from providing constructive comment.  This should be improved immediately",

I recommend everyone to not buy stuff from here I rather order from wish then here. wish takes like 1 month and you get the order or refund is easy but here it take 3 months + and the refund process is barely possible or easy to do. Screw this app.",

I have been using this app for a long time and they have never failed me once. I prefer this app more than wish because shipping at AliExpress is actually free and you can but items as cheap as .89 cents.  So far I am in love with this app. I hope you will enjoy it as well.",

Also, you have to be realistic about the things you buy, you can’t expect a long lasting beautiful necklace if you’re only paying $3 for it.

AliExpress kept telling me to wait longer. I waited so long, asking and disputing the whole time, that they auto completed the order because it had been 3 months. The seller kept lying and then just ignored me. I’ve always had good experiences with the hundreds of things I’ve bought over the years but  this made me very leery of ever using them again. So I’m done.",

Please look at reviews and most definitely make sure the reviews have photos so you can kind of get a hint on how it looks, also shipping take ages so just be aware of that but literally it’s a really good un pricey app.",
