If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it is clearly something the developers haven’t heard before. And why the hell can I still not buy and download kindle books using the app?\n\nEdit: The app was reverted back to the old version a few days after this review but has now changed back again. You get nothing but bad reviews every time you push this ridiculous, user unfriendly update. People like the old version, it’s easy to Use, everything is easy to find and and it’s aesthetically pleasing. All things that this new version is not.

    "review": "In many ways I love this app; everything just works… except that for some bonkers reason you have removed the ability to sort wishlists. All of my family add priorities to wishlists, particularly before Christmas and birthdays. Many items on our lists are simply notes to self, household bits and pieces, etc, which we may or may not return to. Highest and high priority items are those that we’d genuinely like to receive as gifts. People we invite to the lists have to be able to see these items, and only these, not the miscellaneous other stuff. The removal of our ability to actually view these priorities easily has ruined the whole point of using lists for gift purchases, and caused much frustration. \n\nPlease fix it, so that your features don’t corral us in ways you want us to go but instead focus on helping us to do what we want, which is ultimately to easily buy the right things from you.",

    "review": "Cannot share a product!! It’s so hit and miss. Firstly it’s almost impossible for anyone to realise where the share button is. Once it’s found (hovering over the actual product images) it’s impossible to tap and select! \nIt just does not work on countless products. Make it easier! Make it simple. Place the share button at the top right next to the product title/name. Or under the pricing or in the description. Anywhere but on top of the images. You click on the share button and sometimes it opens the image itself. I’m having to screenshot products to send or just give up and go on the browser/laptop. Absurd UI. Plenty of other reviews have talked about dark patterns too and it’s obvious. Results shown in-App are different to in browser. This should be a super slick and easy way to search for products. Sharing products to compare with your friends or family should be just straightforward. Why have you made the above difficult?",

It’s incredibly frustrating! So, after many several years using the app, I’ve gone back to the desktop version. GET THIS FIXED GUYS!",

My wife and I are now having to use the web site as the app version should not even be allowed on the app store. This is not a single instance as my wife and I have a tablet each and the faults are the same on both tablets. Amazon’s cure is to reinstall the apps. Having already done this a few times, they do not specify how often this has to be done before a miracle occurs and it suddenly starts becoming usable.",
