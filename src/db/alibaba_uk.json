    "review": "I have purchased several items from this site, and it is in fact now the only place I buy my fountain pens from (I use fountain pens for writing, calligraphy and drawing so I have a large collection of them), as I have purchased pens from UK retailers priced in the ¬£10-¬£30 range that are out performed by pens from AliExpress that literally cost e ¬£1.31 including shipping (and no that decimal is not in the wrong place!) Literally the only con I can find to using this site is the extended delivery times (on average items take 2-8 weeks to arrive), but shipping is usually free and the item is coming from china. I have no issue waiting for my items to arrive as the wait is worth the money saved and the quality of the items (Please keep in mind I have very little experience buying anything other than fountain pens).\nIf you are unsure, I would recommend that you purchase a cheap item as a trial run and see how you get on, i did and I have been using the site now for over a year and have many happy transactions under my belt with literally zero issues (so far - touch wood - I don‚Äôt want to jinx myself lol). So in short, buy something cheap to try it, with thousands of items for a ¬£1 and under with free shipping what have you got to lose? Apart from a pound of course, but you‚Äôll lose more than that down the back of your sofa!!!",

    "review": "it is so easy to be tempted to buy!\nSadely, the shops too often lie on the price as a fishing technique.\nThe price change when selecting color or country of origine, by the way ; How does the buyer knows the country of origin?  my last delivery arrive ok but the packaging was all crushed and broken! so I am affraid to buy any more fragile item! Some pictures are too beautifull to be true! I mean it is most of the time better picture than the imitation they will send to you , and yes sadely , not all the sellers are honest! The robots have limitations and often cannot understand your queries.  \nAny ways, I like visiting Ali express on my app,  The app is  funny, you can find so many things to buy ! \nFrom GB , customs fees are up !  This is to discourage me to buy online from abroad! Also , deliveries are sometimes very slow because of long periode of transit! But, when the item is not delivered, AliExpress may help with remboursements of lost parcels, That help! Iwont recommend you to buy more than one item per order, you may not receive more than one and the system make no difference, so ...  With  Ali app, you have some funny games , but you ll never win big! Even if sometimes the app keep showing me items selected and paid before! It is enjoyable. you can also chat with sellers  usualy that help. Many thanks !",

    "review": "I have been ordering goods from AliExpress for about one and a half years and I always look forward to getting my packages.  I have mainly bought things for nails, arts and crafts, and some jewellery.  It is incredibly rare that I have felt disappointed.  Out of the three hundred plus little (and some large) packages that I have received it has only happened a couple of times.  Also it is very rare for something to get lost in the post, which in any case is not the fault of the seller.  Even during the early days of the pandemic when delivery was slower I was able to follow the packages on the tracking information to check their progress.  If something happens to get lost you can open a dispute to get your money returned.  \n\nAfter my laptop broke I downloaded the app to my iPhone and I now do all of my browsing and purchasing on AliExpress on the app.  It is easy to use and very convenient.  I was concerned before that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see the products well enough and that there wouldn‚Äôt be the same amount of information about the products.  However, my fears were unfounded and I found that I actually preferred it to the computer, especially because AliExpress has invested so much in the app to make it easy to use.  Try it !",

    "review": "If you‚Äôre a very impatient person like me I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app, I have ordered 2 products on there so far. I ordered a phone case and it arrived after several weeks. it took so long to arrive I totally forgot I ordered it. I ordered a bracelet on the 9th of September and it is now the 21st of October and it‚Äôs still not here. The package tracking seems inaccurate it hardly ever changes it stays on one stage for weeks. When tracking my bracelet once a week it says ‚Äúleft country of origin‚Äù and it‚Äôs been like that for a long time there‚Äôs no updates of what‚Äôs happening with the package. Not a good place to buy a gift because it‚Äôs not guaranteed it‚Äôll come on time. You could order something a month and half or even 2 months before someones birthday and it could still arrive late because it‚Äôs coming from China. I‚Äôm convinced majority of products sold on Ali express come from China. Yes the products are good quality but the waiting is unbearable. Several weeks for a little silver bracelet is ridiculous and I won‚Äôt be ordering from Ali express again. You‚Äôre better off ordering from eBay or other online stores where your packages arrive in 2 weeks maximum. Also when trying to get in contact with the seller I never get the answer I‚Äôm looking for and never actually talk to an actual person, it‚Äôs always a bot that gives automatic replies with information that isn‚Äôt useful to me. It‚Äôs almost impossible to solve problems through messages.",

    "review": "I've ordered a lot of stuff from AliExpress (roughly 40+ items), including clothes, nail products (mainly polygel and dip powders), make-up, phone cases and craft equipment (diamond art).\nYou do have to wait a minimum of about two weeks for delivery to the UK, but once you see the quality of the stuff, you really won't mind waiting. I've only had 2 items not arrive but have had full refunds from the sellers. The majority of my purchases have arrived within 2-3 weeks but I have had to wait nearly 2 months for a couple of things. I don't mind this though because as the weeks pass, I have forgotten what I've ordered and so every package is a nice surprise! üòÜ The majority of items are free postage as well so you can't really complain about waiting times.\nI've also never had a purchase arrive broken or damaged in any way so that's always a massive plus! \nWhen ordering clothing, keep in mind that Chinese sizes are a lot smaller than most countries and so you will definitely need to size up. I'm a size 8/10 and usually buy an XL or XXL depending on how I want it to fit (I like the baggy, oversized look) and even then a couple of the items have fit like a small to medium.",

I have been shopping here for a few years and like it more than Wish etc. I am a little upset about the tax increases due to the import duty implemented by my country (uk) recently but still items are far cheaper than elsewhere. A few items have been bad or simply not arrived at all but I have been refunded each time. I like shopping from sellers who have a lot of photo reviews from previous customers. I find many sellers to be friendly and approachable when asking questions. The app itself is easy to use and has a few fun features; playing games to win coins and vouchers for example. One of the more unique aspects is finding an item by using image search. I have bought handbags, jewellery, craft supplies, clothes, cosmetic brushes, utensils, accessories for my phone and car, pretty much anything under the sun! The only thing I would not purchase from here would be cosmetics or items for very young children but this is a personal preference.",

    "review": "You can find all kinda products here from very low prices, most with no shipping(some do) cost at all. In some store or online you have to spend certain amount of money to be eligible for free shipping however you can order from Ali express as little as ¬£1 and get free delivery. It is not like WISH at all. Wish charges for delivery of every product that's why I don't like shopping in wish. Shopping with AliExpress has been like a habit. It's very convenient for me. If you are a shopaholic like me who likes buying little things such as mobile and fashion accessories, clothes and shoes. You can try buying from AliExpress. Some products quality may be little lower however you can check reviews from thousands of other buyers before purchasing ( which I reckon). Deliveries may take from 2-6 weeks in the UK however It can be delivered quicker or later than that depending on regions. One more thing I like about AliExpress is that you can contact the seller if you have any concerns and worries about the product. Well so far, it has been a really good experience shopping with AliExpress.",

I am usually dubious ordering online when I‚Äôm not familiar with the seller but this app is fantastic and very easy to use, I used to shop on eBay for clothes but found sizing and quality were not up to scratch and the selection is not as extensive.  Absolutely beautiful clothes which for the price are fantastic quality ! reviews from other buyers are so helpful and point you in the right direction I have even bought some lovely things for my daughter who is 7 and usually river island is our one stop shop but as I say the quality and price on Ali express is second to none.  The only downside is as the sellers mainly ship from China or the US delivery can take a while so that should be taken into account,  I have had some things that have been delivered within 2 weeks and other items I‚Äôm still waiting on some I ordered maybe 4 weeks ago so I think it depends on the individual seller.

    "review": "Buying experience using AliExpress app has been a great experience. Product price updates on your favourites list are pushed out to you to inform of price updates and gives you the option of purchasing at a better price, so you never miss that deal. This is one of the many features this app has. Biggest failing though is the inability to block sellers that either you have had a bad experience with (and I have had a couple) or have a bad reputation overall. Something that SHOULD be an option for the customer. Having no control over this is difficult with thousand of sellers with many similar sounding names makes it impossible to manage without this facility made available. AliExpress MAKE THIS AVAILABLE PLEASE. two stars off for not having this option. *6 months later and still this option is a miss. Clearly listening yo the customer is not high on the agenda. Minus another star! ***12 months later still no change*** come on give me the option to block the bad and fake sellers I have come across! It should be my option to eliminate them from my view!",

The best part is that I always manage to find unique pieces and people are asking me where I got it from, when I post on social media or when people see me wearing it on the streets. \n\nI literally buy pretty much everything I need in my life. I always tell people that the only thing I didn‚Äôt find on AliExpess is a human being. However, someone you is not familiar with the site might quickly get scammed. So, my advice is to always read the reviews as this is the best way to see what the items looks like once the customer received it. Another thing is to always buy from good rated stores, for example with over 90%. Check the stars next to the store name too ( I only buy if the store has 4 or 5 stars). Another tip is to check how long the store has been selling on AliExpress, the longer the better. Anyway with time, you‚Äôll love it.",

One have to spend a lot of time and effort to keep track if items arrive after a few months. There is a very high percentage of something wrong with the goods. Ranging from clothing with one sleeve much longer than the other. Ashtray arrived in 2 separate parts, zips of bags came apart on 1st use, items with dead insects inside packaging, sealed boxes meant to be full were only half filled, goods with toxic smell.. the list goes on. That is if the item arrives. \nThe worst experience is having to deal with the seller or contacting customer service attempting to resolve the issue. It got to the point that I have to make video showing from opening the sealed package to inspection of goods just in case I have to forward it as proof. Often I can only get part refund as we all know that the cost of returning goods to China would often cost more than the goods. \nShopping at AliExpress caused too much grief and not worth my time and effort. \nPlease note that there are customs duty and ¬£8 Royal Mail handling fee for items over ¬£15.",

You get what you pay for, don‚Äôt expect too much because it‚Äôs very cheap for us (for them, shippings is high overseas and some don‚Äôt need us to pay for that). The waiting game of course will be long however you just have to be patient. Some products are gimicky, others thought are pretty, cute, fun and unique. The app itself is organised, easy to use and the coins/rewards programme is pleasant. You can earn rewards and coins each day in exchange for discount or products.

Most times it‚Äôs frustrating, as you plan on buying items using a coupon but it‚Äôs almost impossible to find out how to use the coupon. This has not changed over the years, I wish AliExpress would do something, it would have a positive impact on their sales.\n\nIt would probably be better if the coupons have matching colours to the products or matching numbers. Any other method would be better than what exists. The word colour I think means description.\n\nYou click on a coupon thinking it will logically guide you to the items you can choose from but even that did not work.\n\nThe coupon system has to be and needs to be changed or a better explanation is required as to how it works.\n\nIf you do not use the coupons everything else seems okay.

I opted for NX7 pins and this fits nice and tight but not perfectly as it leaves 2mm gap. Maybe I should have selected different fitting. \n\nThe immediate impression of the sound with this cable and LG V30 was the low end increased and the Bass was more visceral.

Send me your address, I don‚Äôt mind sending your stupid thermometer back to you and I will even pay the postage to proof to you that you are notHing but a deliberate scammer seller or I trash the thermometer.

When I tried to raise a dispute it was closed without my knowledge or consent. What a waste of 6 hours of my life.\nThe customer service feature where you speak apparently to someone on web chat is awful. They tell lies and promise the earth to resolve your issue and never do, and guess what, there is no escalation process which allows you to speak to an actual person!! How ridiculous is that?

I requested them to refund but they ask for the proof of not getting it delivered. Now what am I meant to send?? I asked them to contact courier service, but they in return asked me to contact and find out for them. Do you think I would have time for all those stuff being pregnant. Because I wanted home delivery , I ordered online, if I had tha much time to go out and purchase I wouldn‚Äôt ever order from here. Ali express team is useless to help and asking me for proof of not getting the pillow. ¬£25 went in drain. I had to suffer and get another pillow from eBay and revived in 3 days via my Hermes courier service. Wish I can share picture of that parcel and pillow.",

I opened a dispute on AliExpress and submitter my evidence, however, in their initial judgement AliExpress supported the seller of the goods. Fortunately, the seller decided to refund me on his own initiative, so I am not out of pocket and will be buying that item that didn‚Äôt arrive in a brick and mortar shop across the street. But this taught me a lesson and in the future I will be using this app only for purchase of low value knick knacks.",

Then when you ask for the e-mail address of their complaints department they lie and your email gets bounced back. \n\nSo, yes - only ever buy if you are happy to buy another item should it ever break.

The supplier stated only that they had shipped the correct goods (car parts) but what actually arrived was completely unrelated (a picture poster).\n\nDespite raising a dispute immediately and providing photographic evidence, Ali Express considered this to be a \"logistics issue\" and paid the supplier and refused me a refund or replacement.\n\nIn my opinion this makes Ali Express a scam organisation and I will never use them again.",
