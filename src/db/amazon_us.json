This may be something that’s already stressed,But again adding a comment section might improve deliveries .",

Any time I want to apply filters, I have to tap > open drop down > select filter properties > tap \"See ## Results\". I'm not able to apply multiple filters without the entire page refreshing and taking me back to my dashboard. Some filter properties also can't be selected which makes searching for clothing and shoe items really difficult. I.e. I am trying to search for women's sneakers in size 9—the size 9 filter property is listed, but is gray'd out and can't be selected. It just makes searching for items in specific sizes and styles impossible. \n\nThe app also has consistent issues with scrolling. Most of the time, I have to close and reopen the app a few times before I can actually scroll down a page without it bouncing back to the top automatically. \n\nI have no idea if the issues mentioned above stem from how Amazon's app and website function, or if it's an issue with my phone, but either way I usually end up feeling too frustrated to want to continue searching for things in-app.",

Why do you waste half my time on your application by showing me results that have those bright red letters that say “this cannot be shipped to your location”? You already know that, so why are you showing me products I can’t buy? There should be a preference to turn that off. My second pet peeve is that so many items cannot be shipped to a PO Box. Why? It’s not our fault that the Postal Service doesn’t provide delivery to our physical address, or my 100,000 neighbors in the MatSu Borough. Third, why can’t I mark a book or other product so that I never see it again?I keeping being shown the same books that I’m not interested in over and over again.

Then when they gave me an option to send them my credit card information, I choose not to.

So now all accounts I make are suspended and the support team told me they refuse to accept money from me. My mistake was making a new account after they suspended my account, but they suspended my account for not giving them my credit card information, then refused to review the account for a year. No one works there to intentionally screw with customers, but their rules and how they treat them is certainly not professional.

There are products with hundreds or thousands of five Star reviews which are obviously fake. If you look at the users review history you can see the user has posted the exact same review for different products. How does Amazon’s AI not catch this?? \n\nAnother bug is sometimes there are several reviews for the wrong product mixed in with the product you are viewing, as if the product IDs got mixed up at some point. For example, a fish tank might have multiple reviews and photos for a travel pillow. Totally unrelated products got their reviews mixed together. This means the average star rating must be wrong. \n\nOverall, product star ratings are unreliable if these issues are not fixed. \n\nA few other annoyances of the app are:\n\n- They removed infinite scroll in search results. You are forced to click “Next”, and shown paid ads at the bottom of the search results. At least let us increase the number of results per page. \n\n- Filters functionality keeps changing. And there should be a way to set your own defaults for filtering and sorting.  \n\n- The default sort order for Searches is to show “Featured” products first.

After a week with no shipping notification, I followed up and customer service informed me I’d receive an email when these items ship because they’re not in stock! This was horrible! I had to cancel those orders and place re-orders for these items Atleast twice after that incident of information not being updated or relayed to the customer. Lastly, I’m a prime member and every single order I’ve had to pay nearly half the cost of my order in shipping! Why bother offering prime if I’m still charged sooooo much in shipping?!",

You should be able to add things to a list from the “save later” section. Your list should be able to updated from changes by pulling down on the screen to refresh (to clear out items that were moved or deleted). After moving/deleting several things sometimes the app starts to run into issues with errors or crashes altogether. I will add more things periodically. App developers please help!!",

With all the updates recently, it has to reload the page each time I want to add a filter even if it is a deeper level of the same type of filter. I also used to be able to use a search term and select ANY category I was interested in. Now a search term may only yield a few options to narrow a category. Example: I search for “stainless steel” and I can’t refine my search by the category of “arts, crafts and jewelry making”. If change the search term to “stainless steel charms”, I can refine my search by “arts, crafts and jewelry making”. The problem is that “charms” may not be the exact thing I am looking for and I want a more broad search but not so broad that I get entirely unrelated items.",

I searched for “outdoor chairs” and filtered it to sort from price low to high. I expected to find those cheapo plastic outdoor chairs at the top of the list, but instead I was hit with so many $0.01 chair cushions. For one, I was looking for chairs, not chair cushions. For two,$0.01 is the price.... really? Cmon they are just doing that to get at the top of the screen when someone sorts low to high. Please make a report button for listings so we can report these companies who implement such shady business practices. \n\nI never ended up finding what I’m looking for but I bet I’ll find it in two seconds on the Walmart or Menards app.",

The new grid doesn’t even format correctly on my phone screen, the two columns aren’t centered. The left column takes up the bulk of the screen cutting off part of the right column. \n\nThe continuous scroll was a thousand times more user friendly than the next and previous button. This is my biggest complaint. It literally takes the enjoyment out of shopping. Previously I’d scroll through lots of options and decide on the best purchase. Now I wait for each page of unaesthetic grid style options to load and once I think I’ve narrowed down my options I have to load and scroll through each page again to find where the items I liked are. \n\nLook, if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.",

    "review": "This app used to work perfectly, but in the last month it has had so many problems that I don’t even use the app anymore. The first problem I began experiencing was it wouldn’t place things in my cart....at all. Or if I had items in my cart, the number would show above the cart icon, but when I clicked on the cart itself it would say my cart was empty. Lastly, I would try to place items in my cart and it would tell me I was not logged in, when clearly I was logged in since it said my name at the top. I would have to log back in and then it would still give me the same message. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled several times. Here’s to trying ONE MORE TIME before I say screw this app and just delete it altogether.",

I decided not to purchase anything so I can spend time writing this critical review. \n\nUpdate 2: So now the link at the top to customer reviews just reloads the page. What’s the point? Then if you try to search questions / answers it returns with nothing. I even tried a keyword from the question that appeared at the top and it returns with no results. This isn’t an issue on the iPhone. Can you fix it on the iPad? It’s annoying.\n\nOriginal review:\nSo the carousel below to quickly save items is gone and now the search is very annoying. If I select an item on the third page and go back out it takes me to the first page of results. WHY!?!?!? It’s very annoying.",

I see things all the time and in order to get to buying it I have to go through my lists to find it. So I just don’t purchase any of them, it becomes a time consuming task and makes it feel like a hassle.",

What I have observed with the newer version is the filter option where you may have to go through more steps to get to what you want and the pay option is on a slide bar that clicking a button. I didn’t mind the change, but the consistent crashes is counterproductive.",

The only way to read that text, is to leave the app and use a browser. That defeats the purpose of having an app. \n\nThis app is not currently worth downloading.

By then there was no time for the order to be filled so l had to pick another delivery time: 2 to 4pm. I was not sure this system was working since l had not received any acknowledgement of the receipt of my order from Whole Foods. Upon checking my computer l found my cart still open and waiting fo me to place my order! Luckily l got an evening delivery time so l did get my groceries before 8pm. I will not use this app for grocery orders in future.",

Change it back. There was nothing wrong with it. There is no need to change it or constantly do pointless updates. As long as it is running smoothly, thats all that matters, remove the hideous new layout.",

When I try to sign in it tells me my password is wrong when i know good and well it isn’t.  Then I have close the app multiple times just for for me to have to go to a link to approve that it’s me and I’m trying To buy something.  When I sign in, I want it to stay signed until I sign out",

So if you’re looking at a product and you just want to review it and then go back to the others you cannot. Also there’s no share icon to share a product with someone else. Are use the cell phone version and it works just fine. My only problem is with my iPad version.",

But only major flaws it has for me is that it’s very glitchy and takes forever to load certain places like my account info or orders. Some things I click on won’t open up as if they aren’t meant to be clicked on. App is good for convenience, but in all honesty I’ll just stick to web version. It’s must faster.",

    "userName": "Jmack71",
    "review": "Well the app keeps the overall star rating, you cannot view individual reviews. It’s unclear what happened, or why they removed the ability to look at lower reviews. Any more, the overall reviews are skewed by all the fake five star reviews and you really need to drill down into reviews by actual purchasers. You don’t seem to be able to do that anymore, at least on the app. You have to go to a desktop to get individual reviews.",

I have this big beautiful screen yet you’ve chosen to use the smallest font possible.   The clock and scroll feature on images of the item is now terrible.   This is a classic case of fixing something that wasn’t broken so that you can justify your salary.  Whoever was in charge of this last update should be sent to work for Walmart whose app is now easier to use than yours!!!",

    "review": "I did not install an update for the app and suddenly it has a completely new UI (update is still waiting to install). All of my other apps have dark mode and this new UI is even brighter than the old one, with bright blue colors and no dark mode option! Even the Ebay app has dark mode.\n\nThe new layout feels cumbersome since they moved all the classic options I was familiar with to different parts of the screen, and it has a constant floating bar on the bottom which takes up unnecessary screen space.",
